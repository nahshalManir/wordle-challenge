# Wordle Challenge


## Overview
This project is a clone for the Wordle Challenge game of The New
York Times with some slight changes. Unlike the original game
which provides a single Wordle each day, this project lets you
play as much as you want.


## Description
The game is very simple. You have to guess the a secret five
letter word and you will have six guesses. You will get hints
from each of your guesses to help you in your subsequent guesses.
After each guess, all five letters will be overlayed with 3 colors.\
\
Grey overaly indicates that the letter is not present in the word.\
Yellow overlay indicates that the letter is present in the word, 
just not in the correct position.\
Green overlay indicates that the letter is in the correct position
in the word.
